import React from "react";
//* ======================= HOOKS ====================================
//! Hooks are the special functions that allow us to use states with
//! functional components instead of Class-based components

//* They are included to the React in 16.8 version.
//? There are various built-in Hooks like useState(), useEffect(),
//? useContext() etc.
//? Morover, we can also create our custom hooks.

//* Hook Usage Rules:
//* 1. First, we must import.
//* 2. Only call Hooks at the top level. Don’t call Hooks inside loops,
//*    conditions, or nested functions.
//* 3. Only call Hooks from React function components. Don’t call Hooks
//*    from regular JavaScript functions.
//*    (There is just one other valid place to call Hooks

//* =====================================================================

const Hooks = () => {
  return <div>Hooks</div>;
};

export default Hooks;
